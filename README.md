## Clarified

Clarified is an eye dropper utility for Windows that was inspired by [xScope](http://xscopeapp.com/) and Github for Windows. It’s goal is to bring the power of Loupe to designers working in Windows.

Clarified allows you to select multiple colors, and provides you with the Hex, RGB, and HSL values for each.

NOTE: Clarified was built using Microsoft’s .NET Framework 4.5. If you do not have that, you can download it here: [http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30653](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30653).
